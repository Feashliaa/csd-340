                        <p>I'm an avid fan of video games, and I've been playing them since I was a
                            kid. I've played games on a multitude of platforms, including the Playstation, Nintentdo,
                            and
                            predominantly the PC. I've played a wide variety of games, including MMORPGs, FPSs, and
                            RTSs.
                            I've also played a lot of World of Warcraft, and I play a lot of the Sid Meier's
                            Civilization
                            series, and have put in hundreds of hours into both.</p>

                        <p>I very much enjoy collecting things, and I've been doing it since I was a kid. I've collected
                            mainly a lot of tools, and I've amassed a large collection of them. Most of them are hand
                            tools, such as pocket knives, multitools, and so on. I've also collected a lot of other
                            things, such as cool looking rocks, and I've even collected a few coins. I very much enjoy
                            my knife collection the most, and even though I've been collecting them for a long time, I
                            still enjoy adding to it. Some people might find it strange that I collect knives, but I
                            find it very interesting, and I enjoy the variety of knives that are out there. </p> Below
                        is the picture of my current favorite in my collection, a Spyderco Para 3 in Carbon Fiber.

                        <p>I very much enjoy cooking, and I pride myself in my ability to cook. I've
                            been cooking for the past few years, and I predominantly enjoy cooking steaks. I've cooked a
                            lot
                            of different types of steaks, and I've come to find a lot of hidden cuts out there with my
                            favorite being a brazilian cut called Picanha. I've cooked them on a variety of different
                            methods, including the grill, the oven, and the stove, however I've found that cooking them
                            using a sous vide machine is the best way to cook them. Make sure to cook them to your
                            preference, and finish them off on a nice cast iron to get that nice crust on them. </p>

                    My Education has been a very interesting journey, and I've learned a lot of things along the way,
                    and have
                    gained a lot of experience in a multitude of different sectors of programming. I've achieved an

                    degree in Computer Information Systems, and I'm currently working on my bachelors degree in
                    Software. I maintained
                    a 3.6 GPA throughout my time in college, and look to maintain that through the end of my studies.

                    During my life I have learned a lot of different skills, mainly in the sector of programming.
                    Languages that I've worked with and have learned include C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java,
                    Visual Basic, SQL, Java, and a bit of x86 Assembly. To me it seems like I'm learning to be a jack of
                    all trades, and I'm very interested in learning as much about programming as I can.
